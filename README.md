# Project Name: Rick and Morty Gallery

## Description of the Project

Using the Rick & Morty API (rickandmortyapi.com) display the profiles of the characters (with
pagination).
The profile of a character should include:

- Image
- Character information (name, species, etc).
- Origin and location information (name, dimension, amount of residents, etc).
- Name of the chapters the character is featured on.
  The API provides REST and GraphQL versions.
  You are free to use any library/framework or even language. Be ready to explain the rationale
  for your choices.
  The exercise should be submitted to a public repository. Make sure that running your solution
  requires no global dependencies (besides node/npm/yarn) and it's possible to run it with only
  one command (besides yarn/npm install).
  Write the code with production standards in mind.
